# Fluent Python Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, observations, and experiments while reading "Fluent Python".
Here I collect:

ðŸ’¡ Ideas and insights about approaches discussed in the book  
ðŸ§ª Code experiments to test and deepen my understanding of the material  
ðŸ““ Interview preparation notes (Python core, algorithms, data handling)  

The goal is to create a structured knowledge base that I can easily revisit and update throughout the learning process.
